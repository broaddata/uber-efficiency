# Uber Efficiency tet
By John Houlgate
## Introduction
One of the most intriguing aspects of being an Uber rideshare driver is that it affords the driver an opportunity to provide a valuable service, while working intimately with data. As a driver with an interest in data science, I found myself wondering how I might use data science methods and practices to improve my driving efficiency and hopefully earn more money. I’ve been driving on the platform since November of 2014, first as a part-time driver in the suburbs around Portland, OR and then later going full-time when Uber and Lyft were permitted to operate within the city limits. This work involves working with a cloud server and smartphone app system. This system constantly processes data from the time you log in and ‘go-online’ until calling it quits for the day and going home. Uber makes a certain amount of data available to drivers, ostensibly to help them in their work and determine their tax write-offs. I believe this data can also lead to some insights that can aid their performance and decision-making to make more efficient use of their time. As with any exploration, some data can reveal some new insights, stimulate more questions, and hopefully this project will open the door to more possibilities. 
First, a little background is in order. An Uber driver is a self-employed individual who uses Uber’s platform to connect with customers and drive them to where they want to go. The driver logs onto a smartphone app that’s mounted in his car, making himself available for ride requests. The Uber servers receive requests from interested persons, locates the nearest available driver and sends the request to that driver. The driver either accepts or rejects the request. If he chooses the former, his app shows location details where his customer waits for him. The driver goes to the pickup spot, meets the customer-passenger(s), begins the fare and drives to the customer’s destination. At the end of the trip, the driver ends the fare, which is charged automatically to the customer’s account and the two parties go their merry ways. The money exchange functions completely as a cashless, online transaction.
The problem I want to solve is really to answer the questions, how efficient am I?  How can I become more efficient? And how can I use data science to learn more about my driving habits and experience? To answer those questions, I need to come up with definitions of efficiency in this context, then use whatever data I can acquire to analyze and see more clearly what it is telling me. Efficiency here comes in the following areas:

To answer those questions, I need to come up with definitions of efficiency in this context, then use whatever data I can acquire to analyze and see more clearly what it is telling me. Efficiency here comes in the following areas:

__Time__: - How much time am I spending earning fares in relation to the total time I make myself available to give rides.
__Mileage__: - How many miles am I driving while earning fares relative to the total miles I put on the car when I go out to rideshare.
__Earnings__: - How many dollars am I earning per every hour I am out ridesharing? How much do my daily earnings vary and what causes them to vary.
Are there any correlations between the above three modes of efficiency given above? Are their particular days in which I am earning more efficiently than on other days?
